### Hey there. 🦦
During Spring 2022, I was a student in the Per Scholas Software Engineering bootcamp.

During the day, I work in technical project management and technical writing.  

In my spare time, I'm learning web development.    
Right now, I'm continuing to strengthen my understanding of the MERN stack.

This is an archive of my Per Scholas projects. You can see my current work [here](https://# "Professional Portfolio").
