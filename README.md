### Hey there. ðŸ¦¦
During Spring 2022, I was a student in an intense 14 week Software Engineering course sponsored by Per Scholas. Learn about Per Scholas [here](https://perscholas.org/).

In my spare time, I'm learning web development.    
Right now, I'm continuing to strengthen my understanding of the MERN stack.

This is an archive of my Per Scholas projects.
